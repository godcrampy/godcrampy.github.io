      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a software engineer based in the UK.</p>
      <p>
        I study and work around distributed systems. While I don't have a
        favourite programming language, I frequently use Java and tinker with Go
        every now and then.
      </p>

      <p>
        My journey in academia started with mathematics as my primary interest. 
        With time, discrete mathematics and number theory paved the way for theoretical
        computer science and algorithms. I interned at Deutsche Bank in the summer of 2021.
        I obtained a bachelor's in computer engineering in the summer of 2022 and moved to 
        the UK soon after.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quite often, you may find me in a local coffee shop studying, taking
        notes and thinking on paper. While I specialise in designing software
        and microservices, I have a generalist, first-principle view towards
        complex problems. My notes are usually a Socratic dialogue on whatever
        I'm thinking about. I understand a complex topic if I can explain it to
        the barista without jargon. That said, I do love a warm cup of coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a history buff, especially when it intersects with my areas of work.
        Here's a photo of Alan Turing's desk from my last visit to Bletchley
        Park.<br />

        I am pretty fortunate that I get to work every day on the one thing I
        love - <b>Engineering</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I frequently have stints of complete absence from social media when I
        try to <b>embrace boredom</b
        >.<br />The best way to reach out to me would be via email.

            <b><a href="https://github.com/godcrampy/fireflydb">FireflyDB</a>: </b>One Christmas break, I got fascinated and read a lot about storage engines.
            I spent a few weekends writing my own. FireflyDB is a fast, thread-safe, JVM-based key-value storage engine with microsecond latency. 
            It's an order of magnitude faster than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcask">Bitcask</a>, an equivalent popular piece of 
            software with similar architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b><a href="https://github.com/godcrampy/py-graphics-h">PyGraphics</a>: </b>I took up a computer graphics course at my university. Unfortunately,
            graphics.h, a mandatory library, didn't work on my Linux machine. Hence,
            I built a Python CLI to parse and execute C programs with graphics.h
            dependency. It executes C programs without compiling a binary. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.godcrampy.svnit&hl=en&gl=US">SVNIT101</a>: </b>A university project where I tinkered with Android programming and built
            an app with a collection of valuable resources for university students.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b><a href="https://dev-cheats.surge.sh/">DevCheats</a>: </b>Another one of my university projects of the time where I got into react
            and UI design. A single-page application that has a few handy cheat sheets.
        </ol>
        <h2>Miscellaneous Things</h2>
        <p>
          While in university, I co-authored a few papers as part of my work on false news classification in
          healthcare:
          <ol>
              <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358271892_A_Novel_Stance_based_Sampling_for_Imbalanced_Data">
                A Novel Stance-based Sampling for Imbalanced Data
              </a><br/>
              <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362781865_Cluster-based_Sampling_for_Fake_News_on_Healthcare_during_COVID-19_Infodemic">
                Cluster-based Sampling for Fake News on Healthcare during COVID-19 Infodemic
              </a>
          </ol>
        </p>
        Also, during university, I worked with the 
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rELIVbhxAhE5crGv2kh2mc39c9tzyTLY/view">police department of Assam</a>
        to develop a GPS-based solution to track patrolling teams on a single
        dashboard in the control centre. 
        <p>
        </p>A lot of my university time was spent
        getting my hands dirty and building things that sometimes worked and
        sometimes didn't. Here's a select few that did (and won a few hackathon
        prizes, too):
        <ol>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6ohAM1oG-I">Watch Wolf</a> <br />
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLNSSHoqGZk">Little Invest Town</a> <br />
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-FUYcP5ghw">ExamBnB</a> <br/>
        </ol> I love teaching. I
        occasionally teach and mentor university students in computer science
        and software engineering.
